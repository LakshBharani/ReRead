# ReRead
ReRead was developed during an Inter-house Green Hackathon event. Built a team with 3 classmates to execute the idea of "Re-read" - a marketplace for giving away school textbooks from Seniors to Juniors. This novel concept was targeted towards saving paper and cost to the environment. My team developed a working prototype and presented it to the panel of judges, and finished 2nd.
